        <h1>Welcome to Gramophone World</h1>
        <h2>The gramophone was invented by Thomas Edison in the late 19th century, 
            with his phonograph invention being the earliest known device to reproduce recorded sound. Edison's phonograph used a cylinder to record and play back sound.
            The disc-based gramophone as we commonly know it today was developed by Emile 
            Berliner in the late 1880s. Instead of using cylinders, Berliner used flat discs
            with spiral grooves to record and play sound...
            The history of the gramophone is a captivating journey through the evolution of sound 
            recording and playback. Its origins trace back to Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville's
            phonautograph in 1857, which visually captured sound waves but lacked playback capabilities.
            Thomas Edison's invention of the phonograph in 1877 marked a breakthrough, enabling both recording and playback. This device etched sound onto rotating cylinders coated with tinfoil. However, Emile Berliner's gramophone, patented in 1887, propelled the technology further by introducing flat discs with lateral grooves for recording and a horizontal stylus for playback.
